    <p>When trying to make time for studying, make a schedule, and be sure to include time and effort for the days that come before your test.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Instead of having an all nighter, trying to remember all of the materials for a test, plan a schedule
    that is a couple of days before your test. Start studying on a Monday for a test that
    is on a Friday, and at the latest, on Wednesday of that week.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> How to Study</p>
    <p>Prepare a space</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a place that you find most comfortable such as a library, your room, the kitchen table, and even outside!</li>
        <li>Declutter!!! Make enough room for all your necessary materials, making the room more organized, will help you become more comfortable and able to plan better.</li>
        <li>Music? Having soft music that doesnâ€™t have words(can distract you),  and background noises such as rain and waterfalls are some of the best ways to become more focused in one's work.</li>
        <li>Move all distractions away. Having a TV on or a constant beeping of a phone on your side is no help when studying. Simply quiet or turn off these devices that can become very distracting when trying to focus.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Use Effective Study Techniques that work for YOU, a technique that works on a friend or a sibling might not work for you, try searching up different types of study techniques that benefit you the most.</p>
    <p>Here are some techniques to put in mind when studying</P>
      <ul>
        <li>Highlight important information, NOT THE ENTIRE TEXTBOOK. People tend to make the mistake of highlighting everything that seems important or for the fun of it. Try highlighting what you might forget easily, important words and phrases, making the best use of your time.</li>
        <li>Make flash cards or use Quizlet</li>
        <li>Summarize what you learned</li>
        <li>Break topics and information into smaller pieces, making materials easier to understand and comprehend.</li>
        <li>Create own study sheets</li>
        <li>Review materials before going to bed, which is called sleep-learning helping you retain more information</li>
      </ul>
