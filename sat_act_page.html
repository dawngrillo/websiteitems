    <div class="sat_act_text">
      The Math and Evidence-Based Reading and Writing sections are scored on a scale of 200 to 800 points for a total of 1600 points. These are called the scaled scores, and are converted from the raw score, which is the number of questions answered correctly. Skipped or incorrect answers are not added or subtracted to the raw score. The College Board also equates each score, since tests on each test day slightly vary.</br>
      Essays have their own, separate scoring system from 2 to 8, with 8 being the highest. Two separate readers score the essay on a scale of 1-4 on categories called Reading, Analysis, and Essay. Then, they are added together for a maximum of 8 total points. </br>
      Viewing and sending scores can be done through the College Board website. </br>
